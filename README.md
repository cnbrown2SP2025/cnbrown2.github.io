# About Me
## My Interests
* I enjoy reading, mostly science fiction or historical fiction
* I'm part of a world class color guard program called _Étude Winterguard_.  
  I spend a lot of my time practicing for that or at rehearsal on the weekends.

This is a picture of me in our finals performace!
* I love going on walks and running outside in the fresh air.  
  If I lived near a park I would go hiking more.
## Websites I Recommend
- [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/search) - I love listening to music and Spotify is great at finding new songs that I actually like.
- [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/browse) - I like watching tv shows and movies on my laptop more than my phone, so I use this site a lot!
